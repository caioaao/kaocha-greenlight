# kaocha-greenlight

Kaocha plugin to run [greenlight](/amperity/greenlight) tests.

## Installing

The project is published through Clojars with the identifier `caioaao/kaocha-greenlight`. You can find version information for the latest release at https://clojars.org/caioaao/kaocha-greenlight.

## Usage

Declare a test suite on your [Kaocha config file](https://cljdoc.org/d/lambdaisland/kaocha/0.0-413/doc/3-configuration) with the type `:caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/test`. You'll also need to provide a value for `:caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/new-system`, which should be a function that receives no arguments and returns [a stuartsierra's system map](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

A `tests.edn` example:

```clojure
#kaocha/v1
{:tests [{:id           :integration
          :type         :caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/test
          :test-paths   ["test"]
          :source-paths ["src"]
          :ns-patterns  ["-flow$"]
          :caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/new-system my.app/system-map}]}
```

You may configure `kaocha-greenlight` to create a new system for each namespace,
which can be useful if you'd like a clean state for each namespace, e.g. if
you're using ephemeral datastores:

```clojure
#kaocha/v1
{:tests [{:id           :integration
          :type         :caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/test
          :test-paths   ["test"]
          :source-paths ["src"]
          :ns-patterns  ["-flow$"]
          :caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/new-system my.app/system-map
          :caioaao.kaocha-greenlight/system-scope :ns}]}
```
